To do:

Done:

*   "But ...": show `(f . id) *** (id . g)` vs `(f *** id) . (id *** g)`.
*   `MaxPlus` with `VectorSpace` instance
*   Resolve smalltriangleup, smalltriangledown.
*   Two-column for `Category` instance derivations, and restore "Uses:".
*   Maybe return to "`(&&&)`" and "`(***)`".
*   Look for illustrations of timing analysis.
